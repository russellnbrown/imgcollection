The freeimage directory in thirdparty contains x32 release, x32 debug and x64 release versions.
They were compiled with VisualStudio 2019 using the 3.18 release available here http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/download.html
If compiling from this source, and using a static build, then ensure FREEIMAGE_LIB is defined. 
You will need to compile FreeImageLib & FreeImagePlus ( in the Wrappers dir )
